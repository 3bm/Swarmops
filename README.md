Swarmops
========

Swarmops is an admin system for swarm-type organizations. It's a bureaucracy system for people who
HATE bureaucracy with all their hearts, so it removes all visibility of it and focuses on the ops aspects.

It manages decentralized authority, volunteers, members, activists, budgets, mass communications,
expenses, payroll, invoices, and complete financials/bookkeeping.

It runs on Debian Linux servers and is in the Public Domain (except for external resources, which are
noted as such).
