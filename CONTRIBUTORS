These people have worked on Swarmops and signed off on the PDAFFIRM
document. To add your name to the list, type the following commands
then commit changes:

echo -e "\n\n[Your Name] ([Email])" >> CONTRIBUTORS
date >> CONTRIBUTORS
gpg --armor --detach-sig PDAFFIRM
cat PDAFFIRM.asc >> CONTRIBUTORS
rm PDAFFIRM.asc

People who choose to not sign this and contribute to the project
still do not hold any claim to exclusive rights over their code; the
README file clearly states that any pull requests, commits, or
contributions of any kind are irrevocably committed to the public
domain. Signing the PDAFFIRM document is therefore more of a strong
version over and above that statement, rather than a legal minimum
requirement.
