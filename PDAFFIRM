[This document is for signing by contributors to Swarmops into the
CONTRIBUTORS file. This is not necessary at the small scale when
it was implemented, but in case Swarmops grows significantly, it
will become so.]

I irrevocably dedicate any and all exclusive monopoly rights, such as
"copyright", in my contributions to Swarmops to the public domain.
I make this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to
the benefit of my heirs and successors, so they may enjoy a freer
spirit of knowledge, culture, and tools for humanity. I intend this
dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all
present and future rights to this software under copyright monopoly
law and other monopoly laws.

To the best of my knowledge and belief, my contributions are either
originally authored by me, or are derived from prior works which I
have verified are also in the public domain and are not legally
subject to claims of exclusive rights by other parties, and I
affirm and certify at I will not make contributions that are
encumbered by rights of exclusivity in any form, unless such
contributions are either:

  1) an External Library, clearly placed in locations for such
     and added after community consensus; or
  2) JavaScript code under MIT license, which are added in
     locations for such and where each script is enumerated in the
     ScriptLicenses file; or
  3) code that is freely redistributable without other encumbrance
     than repeating its status as unencumbered code, such as the
     BCrypt code or similar code people just shouldn't be
     re-implementing, in which case the source code needs to
     indicate its status as foreign but unencumbered code
     (like by including the MIT license in the source itself); or
  4) images where I have an explicit right to redistribute them
     as part of an application like Swarmops, in which case they
     are added to the project with a filename that indicates their
     origin.
